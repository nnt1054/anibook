However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.\r\n\r\nWhen they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno's voice. Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a \"Black Clover\" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the same goal\u2014to become the Wizard King!\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","type":"TV","airing_start":"2017-10-03T09:25:00+00:00","episodes":null,"members":344290,"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"Magic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/16\/Magic"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"source":"Manga","producers":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Pierrot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1\/Studio_Pierrot"}],"score":6.97,"licensors":["Funimation"],"r18":false,"kids":false},{"mal_id":34620,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/34620\/Kono_Yo_no_Hate_de_Koi_wo_Utau_Shoujo_YU-NO","title":"Kono Yo no Hate de Koi wo Utau Shoujo YU-NO","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1009\/100450.jpg?s=481dbe4696d1d2d80ab84803f29514b0","synopsis":"Takuya Arima is a young student whose father, a historian who has conducted various researches, disappeared recently.
